        <p><strong>Last updated: October 9, 2025</strong></p>

        <p>Always Never Almost operates this store and website, including all related information, content, features, tools, products and services, in order to provide you, the customer, with a curated shopping experience (the "Services"). Always Never Almost is powered by Shopify, which enables us to provide the Services to you.

        <h2>How We Use Your Personal Information</h2>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Provide, Tailor, and Improve the Services.</strong> We use your personal information to provide you with the Services, including to perform our contract with you, to process your payments, to fulfill your orders, to remember your preferences and items you are interested in, to send notifications to you related to your account, to process purchases, returns, exchanges or other transactions, to create, maintain and otherwise manage your account, to arrange for shipping, to facilitate any returns and exchanges, to enable you to post reviews, and to create a customized shopping experience for you, such as recommending products related to your purchases.

        <h2>How We Disclose Personal Information</h2>

            <li><strong>With Shopify, vendors and other third parties</strong> who perform services on our behalf (e.g. IT management, payment processing, data analytics, customer support, cloud storage, fulfillment and shipping).</li>
            <li><strong>With business and marketing partners</strong> to provide marketing services and advertise to you. For example, we use Shopify to support personalized advertising with third-party services based on your online activity with different merchants and websites. Our business and marketing partners will use your information in accordance with their own privacy notices.</li>
            <li><strong>When you direct, request us or otherwise consent</strong> to our disclosure of certain information to third parties, such as to ship you products or through your use of social media widgets or login integrations.</li>
            <li><strong>With our affiliates</strong> or otherwise within our corporate group.</li>
            <li><strong>In connection with a business transaction</strong> such as a merger or bankruptcy, to comply with any applicable legal obligations (including to respond to subpoenas, search warrants and similar requests), to enforce any applicable terms of service or policies, and to protect or defend the Services, our rights, and the rights of our users or others.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Relationship with Shopify</h2>
        <p>The Services are hosted by Shopify, which collects and processes personal information about your access to and use of the Services in order to provide and improve the Services for you. Information you submit to the Services will be transmitted to and shared with Shopify as well as third parties that may be located in countries other than where you reside, in order to provide and improve the Services for you. In addition, to help protect, grow, and improve our business, we use certain Shopify enhanced features that incorporate data and information obtained from your interactions with our Store, along with other merchants and with Shopify. To provide these enhanced features, Shopify may make use of personal information collected about your interactions with our store, along with other merchants, and with Shopify. In these circumstances, Shopify is responsible for the processing of your personal information, including for responding to your requests to exercise your rights over use of your personal information for these purposes. To learn more about how Shopify uses your personal information and any rights you may have, you can visit the <a href="https://www.shopify.com/legal/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shopify Consumer Privacy Policy</a>. Depending on where you live, you may exercise certain rights with respect to your personal information <a href="https://privacy.shopify.com/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p>

        <h2>Third Party Websites and Links</h2>
        <p>The Services may provide links to websites or other online platforms operated by third parties. If you follow links to sites not affiliated or controlled by us, you should review their privacy and security policies and other terms and conditions. We do not guarantee and are not responsible for the privacy or security of such sites, including the accuracy, completeness, or reliability of information found on these sites. Information you provide on public or semi-public venues, including information you share on third-party social networking platforms may also be viewable by other users of the Services and/or users of those third-party platforms without limitation as to its use by us or by a third party. Our inclusion of such links does not, by itself, imply any endorsement of the content on such platforms or of their owners or operators, except as disclosed on the Services.</p>

        <h2>Children's Data</h2>
        <p>The Services are not intended to be used by children, and we do not knowingly collect any personal information about children under the age of majority in your jurisdiction. If you are the parent or guardian of a child who has provided us with their personal information, you may contact us using the contact details set out below to request that it be deleted. As of the Effective Date of this Privacy Policy, we do not have actual knowledge that we "share" or "sell" (as those terms are defined in applicable law) personal information of individuals under 16 years of age.</p>

        <h2>Security and Retention of Your Information</h2>
        <p>Please be aware that no security measures are perfect or impenetrable, and we cannot guarantee "perfect security." In addition, any information you send to us may not be secure while in transit. We recommend that you do not use unsecure channels to communicate sensitive or confidential information to us.</p>

        <p>How long we retain your personal information depends on different factors, such as whether we need the information to maintain your account, to provide you with Services, comply with legal obligations, resolve disputes or enforce other applicable contracts and policies.</p>

        <h2>Your Rights and Choices</h2>
        <p>Depending on where you live, you may have some or all of the rights listed below in relation to your personal information. However, these rights are not absolute, may apply only in certain circumstances and, in certain cases, we may decline your request as permitted by law.</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Right to Access / Know.</strong> You may have a right to request access to personal information that we hold about you.</li>
            <li><strong>Right to Delete.</strong> You may have a right to request that we delete personal information we maintain about you.</li>
            <li><strong>Right to Correct.</strong> You may have a right to request that we correct inaccurate personal information we maintain about you.</li>

            <li><strong>Right to Opt out of Sale or Sharing for Targeted Advertising.</strong> Depending on where you reside, you may have a right to opt out of the "sale" or "share" of your personal information or to opt out of the processing of your personal information for purposes considered to be "targeted advertising", as defined in applicable privacy laws. Please note that if you visit our website with the Global Privacy Control opt-out preference signal enabled, depending on where you are, we will automatically treat this as a request to opt-out for the device and browser that you use to visit the website. If we are able to associate the device sending the signal to a Shopify account, we will apply the opt out request to the account as well. To learn more about Global Privacy Control, you can visit https://globalprivacycontrol.org/. Other than the Global Privacy Control, we do not recognize other "Do Not Track" signals that may be sent from your web browser or device.</li>
            <li><strong>Managing Communication Preferences.</strong> We may send you promotional emails, and you may opt out of receiving these at any time by using the unsubscribe option displayed in our emails to you. If you opt out, we may still send you non-promotional emails, such as those about your account or orders that you have made.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>If you reside in the UK or European Economic Area,</strong> and subject to exceptions and limitations provided by local law, you may exercise the following rights in addition to the rights outlined above:</p>

        <p><strong>Objection to Processing and Restriction of Processing:</strong> You may have the right to ask us to stop or restrict our processing of personal information for certain purposes.</p>

        <p><strong>Withdrawal of Consent:</strong> Where we rely on consent to process your personal information, you have the right to withdraw this consent. If you withdraw your consent, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing based on your consent before its withdrawal.</p>

To learn more about how Shopify uses your personal information and any rights you may have, including rights related to data processed by Shopify, you can visit https://privacy.shopify.com/en.</p>

        <p>We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of these rights. We may need to verify your identity before we can process your requests, as permitted or required under applicable law. In accordance with applicable laws, you may designate an authorized agent to make requests on your behalf to exercise your rights. Before accepting such a request from an agent, we will require that the agent provide proof you have authorized them to act on your behalf, and we may need you to verify your identity directly with us. We will respond to your request in a timely manner as required under applicable law.</p>

        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time, including to reflect changes to our practices or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons.
